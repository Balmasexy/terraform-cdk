# Iterators


Iterators let you loop over a collection of values. You can use them to create multiple resources of the same type that are based on dynamic data that is only known at runtime.

## When to Use Iterators

Use iterators when you need to reference dynamic data that is not known until after Terraform applies a configuration. For example, instance IDs that cloud providers assign on creation.

When data is static or you know the values before [synthesizing your code](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#synth), we recommend using loops in your preferred programming language.

## Define Iterators

Import the `TerraformIterator` class and call the `.fromList()` or `.fromMap()` static method. Then use the `forEach` property to pass the iterator to the resource, data source, or module that must use it. This lets you use the iterator in attributes.

The example below uses an iterator to create a unique name for each new S3 bucket.

```ts
import { s3 } from "@cdktf/provider-aws";
import { TerraformIterator, TerraformVariable } from "cdktf";

const list = new TerraformVariable(this, "list", {
  type: "list(string)",
});

const iterator = TerraformIterator.fromList(list.listValue);

const s3Bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, "bucket", {
  forEach: iterator,
  name: iterator.value,
});
```

You cannot access the index of items when iterating over lists. This is because Terraform requires sets for iteration and CDKTF implicitly converts lists to sets when iterating over them. This behavior prevents Terraform from accidentally deleting and recreating resources when their indices change. If you need an index, use `count` and an [escape hatch](/cdktf/concepts/providers-and-resources#escape-hatch) using the [`count.index` property](/language/meta-arguments/count).

## Using Iterators on Complex Types

The iterator also exposes methods to access nested attributes. The example below uses the `getString` and `getStringMap` methods to access the `name` and `tags` attributes of each list item.

```ts
const iterator = TerraformIterator.fromList([
  {
    name: "foo",
    tags: { app: "bar" },
  },
  {
    name: "baz",
    tags: { app: "qux" },
  },
]);

const s3Bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, "bucket", {
  forEach: iterator,
  name: iterator.getString("name"),
  tags: iterator.getStringMap("tags"),
});
```
