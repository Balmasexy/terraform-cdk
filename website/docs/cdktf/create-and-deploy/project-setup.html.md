# Project Setup

There are several ways to create a new CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) project, including creating a new application from a pre-built or custom template, or converting an existing HCL project. When you create a new project, you have the option of storing Terraform state locally, or using Terraform Cloud. This page discusses these setup options in more detail.

> **Hands On**: Check out our [CDK for Terraform Quick Start Demo](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cdktf-install?in=terraform/cdktf) and language-specific [Get Started Tutorials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/cdktf) on HashiCorp Learn.

## Initialize Project from a Template

Use `init` with a project template to automatically create and scaffold a new CDKTF project for your chosen programming language.
Templates generate a new application with the file structure needed for you to start to define infrastructure right away.

The `cdktf-cli` has pre-built templates for supported programming languages, or you can use a custom-built [remote template](/docs/cdktf/create-and-deploy/remote-templates.html).

```bash
$ cdktf init --template="templateName"
```

Use these template names for the available pre-built templates:

- `typescript`
- `python`
- `c#`
- `java`
- `go` (experimental)

### Use a Local Backend

Your application needs somewhere to store [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/index.html). Add the `--local` flag to created a scaffolded project that is pre-configured to use a [local backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/local.html). This means all terraform operations will happen on your local machine.

```
$ cdktf init --template="typescript" --local
```

### Use Terraform Cloud as a Remote Backend

If you don't want to store Terraform state locally, you can configure your app to use Terraform Cloud as a remote backend. Initialize a project without passing the `--local` flag, to prompt CDKTF to use your stored [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/index.html) credentials to create a new workspace for storing state. If you have no stored Terraform Cloud credentials, CDKTF will ask you to login.

The new scaffolded project is configured to use Terraform state with a [remote backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/remote.html). Where the Terraform operations will happen depends on the configuration of the Terraform Cloud Workspace settings. When you create the workspace as part of the `cdktf init` command, Terraform operations will be run locally by default. You can configure the Terraform Cloud workspace to use remote operations instead (see below).

#### Terraform Cloud VCS Integration

Terraform Cloud supports [connecting to VCS providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/vcs/index.html). To use the VCS integration, commit the synthesized Terraform config (the `cdktf.out` directory) alongside your code, so that Terraform Cloud can use it to deploy your infrastructure. On the General Settings page of your Terraform Cloud workspace [set the Terraform working directory](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/settings.html#terraform-working-directory) to the output directory of the stack you want to deploy. So for example, use `cdktf.out/stacks/dev` if your stack is named `dev`. Refer to the [Stacks documentation](./stacks.html) for more information about using stacks to separate the state management for multiple environments in an application.

~> **Important**: The synthesized Terraform config might contain credentials or other sensitive data that was provided as input for the `cdktf` application.

#### External CI service

If you prefer to keep the generated artifacts out of your repository, use any CI (Continuous Integration) service to build and deploy them instead. The CDK for Terraform CLI supports deploying to Terraform Cloud using either the local or remote execution mode. For more information on how runs work in Terraform Cloud, see [Terraform Runs and Remote Operations](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/run/index.html).

In your CI steps use the `cdktf-cli` commands to synthesize your code and deploy your infrastructure:

```
cdktf deploy --auto-approve
```

## Project Configuration

Installing CDK for Terraform with a pre-built template generates a basic `cdktf.json` file in your root directory that you can customize for your application. This config file is where you can define the [providers](/docs/cdktf/concepts/fundamentals/providers.html) and [modules](docs/cdktf/concepts/fundamentals/modules.html) that should be added to the project, and also supply custom configuration settings for the application. Refer to the [cdktf.json documentation](/docs/cdktf/concepts/cdktf-json.html) for more detail.

## Convert Existing HCL project

If you are creating a new project using the `typescript` template, you have the option to create the project from an existing HCL project. To convert an existing HCL project into Typescript, add the `--from-terraform-project` to the `init` command:

```
$ cdktf init --template=typescript --from-terraform-project /path/to/my/tf-hcl-project
```

### Example

Given this HCL configuration

```hcl
# File: /tmp/demo/main.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    random = {
      source = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "3.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "random" {
}

resource "random_pet" "server" {
}
```

When running the convert command like this in a new folder:

```sh
cdktf init --template=typescript --from-terraform-project /tmp/demo --local
```

`cdktf` will bootstrap a Typescript project and generate the configuration.

```jsonc
// File: /tmp/cdktf-demo/cdktf.json

{
  "language": "typescript",
  "app": "npm run --silent compile && node main.js",
  "projectId": "83684893-0e58-4a71-989a-ecb7c593a690",
  "terraformProviders": ["hashicorp/random@3.1.0"],
  "terraformModules": [],
  "context": {
    "excludeStackIdFromLogicalIds": "true",
    "allowSepCharsInLogicalIds": "true"
  }
}
```

```ts
// File: /tmp/cdktf-demo/main.ts

/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/blob/main/docs/working-with-cdk-for-terraform/using-providers.md#importing-providers-and-modules for more details.*/
import * as random from "./.gen/providers/random";

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { App, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";

class MyStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);

    new random.RandomProvider(this, "random", {});
    new random.Pet(this, "server", {});
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyStack(app, "cdktf-demo");
app.synth();
```

The ability to initialize a new CDKTF project from an HCL project is currently limited to projects that use the `typescript` template, but you can use the `cdktf convert` command to convert individual HCL files to another programming language. Refer to the [`cdktf convert` command documentation](/docs/cdktf/cli-reference/commands.html) for more information.
